# Riya Chard Personal Statement

## Summary of Contribution

For my contribution to the coursework, I contributed in 4 ways to the final RISC-V cpu:

1) During Lab 4 I was tasked with implementing the programme counter and next pc blocks.
2) For the Lab 5 brief I was tasked with implementing the Data memory in order to implement the reference programme.
3) I also implemented the artitecture for a shift slli instructure.
4) I worked with Bhavya to understand and implementing the changes indeeded to execute the reference programme. This included the changes indeed to implement load byte and store, implementing adding registers and load upper immidient. 

Over the course 

Each individual's personal statement explaining what they contributed, reflection about what you have learned in this project, mistakes you made, special design decisons, and what you might do differently if you were to do it again or have more time. This statement must be succinct and to the point, yet must include sufficient details for me to check against the push history of the repo so that any claims can be verified. Including links to a selection of specific commits which demonstrate your work is advised.
